			<p>The name says it all! Splash is one of three wave pools located in Ottawa.</p>

              <p>Wave pools provide the perfect destination for visitors to our city including bus tours and group outings. Residents can also enjoy the "surf" or take a leisurely swim when the waves are off. There is also a kiddie pool with spray fountains and whirlpool. The facility also boasts a brand new 25m lap pool with an accessible ramp and a new 32m waterslide!</p>
    
    <p>Learn to swim in a safe and encouraging environment with our qualified aquatic instructors. Whether you are new to swimming or want to improve your swimming techniques, there are programs for all ages and abilities.

If you are uncertain of the swimming level to register in, attend any of our public swims and ask a lifeguard for a swimming level assessment. We also recommend an assessment for those who have never taken formal swimming lessons or have been absent from swimming for more than one year.

Low Ratio Classes have half the participants of our regular classes allowing for more individual attention.

Private Swimming Lessons are designed to assist you to overcome a fear of the water or master a skill on a one to one basis. Book these lessons at the pool of your choice.

Contact your local pool for more information, check the Learn to Swim section of the online Recreation Guide, or register and search for swimming programs.</p>
